# GitHub Repository Setup Guide

**Time required:** 5-10 minutes

This guide will help you create your own copy of this website template and set it up so we can build your personal website together.

---

## üìã What You'll Need

- A GitHub account (free)
- 5-10 minutes
- The domain you want to use (we'll configure it later)

---

## üöÄ Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Create or Sign Into GitHub Account

**If you already have a GitHub account:**
- Go to https://github.com
- Sign in with your credentials
- ‚úÖ Move to Step 2

**If you need to create a new account:**
- Go to https://github.com/signup
- Enter your email address
- Create a password
- Choose a username (this will be part of your repository URL)
- Complete verification
- Choose the **free plan**

---

### Step 2: Create Your Website Repository from This Template

1. **You're already here!** This page is the template repository.

2. **Click the green "Use this template" button** (top right of this page)
   - A dropdown will appear
   - Select **"Create a new repository"**

3. **Configure your new repository:**

   **Owner:** Select your GitHub username (should be auto-selected)

   **Repository name:** Choose a name for your website repo
   - Suggested: `personal-website`
   - Or: `[yourname]-website` (e.g., `john-website`)
   - Must be lowercase, no spaces (use hyphens instead)

   **Description (optional):** "My personal website"

   **Visibility:**
   - ‚úÖ **Private** (recommended) - only you and people you invite can see the code
   - ‚¨ú Public - anyone can see the code (your choice)

   **Include all branches:** ‚¨ú Leave unchecked (we only need the main branch)

4. **Click "Create repository"**
   - GitHub will create your copy of the template
   - You'll be redirected to your new repository page
   - This is now YOUR repository in YOUR account

---

### Step 3: Add Your Developer as Collaborator

If you're working with someone to set up your website (like me!), you'll need to give them access:

1. **In your new repository, click "Settings"**
   - It's in the top menu bar of your repository
   - You should see a left sidebar with many options

2. **Click "Collaborators" in the left sidebar**
   - It's under the "Access" section
   - You may be asked to confirm your GitHub password for security

3. **Click the green "Add people" button**
   - A search box will appear

4. **Add your developer's GitHub username**
   - Type the username they provided you
   - Click on their profile when it appears
   - Click **"Add [username] to this repository"**

5. **They'll receive an invitation**
   - They'll accept it and can then help set up your site
   - You remain the owner - they're a collaborator

---

### Step 4: Share Your Repository Information

Send your developer:

1. **Your repository URL**
   - It looks like: `https://github.com/[your-username]/personal-website`
   - You can copy it from your browser's address bar
   - Or click the green "Code" button and copy the HTTPS URL

2. **Confirmation that you've added them as a collaborator**

**Example message:**
```
Hi! I've created my GitHub repository and added you as a collaborator.

Repository URL: https://github.com/johndoe/personal-website

Let me know if you need anything else!
```

---

## ‚úÖ You're Done!

That's it! Your developer can now:
- Access your repository
- Set up automatic deployment to a hosting platform
- Configure your custom domain
- Implement the features you requested
- Create documentation so you can update content yourself

---

## üîê Privacy & Security Notes

- **You own the repository** - it's in your GitHub account
- **You control access** - you can remove collaborators anytime
- **Version control** - every change is tracked, nothing is lost
- **Private option** - keep your code private if you want
- **Secure** - GitHub uses industry-standard security

---

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

### "I can't find the 'Use this template' button"
- Make sure you're logged into GitHub
- The button is green and in the top right corner of the repository page
- It should be next to "Code" and "Fork" buttons

### "I can't add a collaborator"
- Make sure you're in **your repository** (check the URL - it should have your username)
- Navigate to Settings ‚Üí Collaborators (left sidebar under "Access")
- You may need to verify your GitHub email address first

### "I made a mistake in the repository name"
- No problem! You can rename it: Settings ‚Üí General ‚Üí Repository name
- Or delete it and start over (takes 30 seconds)

### "My collaborator didn't receive the invitation"
- Check that you typed their username correctly
- They should check their email and GitHub notifications
- You can resend the invitation from Settings ‚Üí Collaborators
